# ECE-133A---Applied-Numerical-Computing
This is the set of all programs and functions that I wrote in ECE 133A class taught by Professor Lin Yang in Winter 2022 at UCLA.

There are some important notes:

1) Some of them can be run only with the data files provided in class or posted publicly on Professor Lieven Vandenberghe's website.
2) Some of them were implemented as results of my derivations. In this case, if you want to look at the derivations explicitly, you can always send me an email.
